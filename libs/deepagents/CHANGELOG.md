### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `create_deep_agent` no longer includes `TodoListMiddleware` by default, the `write_todos` tool, `todos` state channel, and todo-planning prompt are now absent. Pass `middleware=[TodoListMiddleware()]` to restore them on the main agent; add it to each `SubAgent`'s middleware to restore them there. ([#4929](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4929)) ([9340518](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/9340518a26c4287f9ad0c543edc9b69106c15154))
* Default agent prompts are now lean: the authored base prompt is empty, and tool-usage prose that duplicates tool schemas is trimmed. `BASE_AGENT_PROMPT` is deprecated (removal in `deepagents==0.9.0`) but remains importable and still returns the previous authored prompt verbatim; pass it as `create_deep_agent(system_prompt=BASE_AGENT_PROMPT)` to restore the old behavior. ([#4859](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4859)) ([#4979](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4979)) ([a8d1b32](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/a8d1b32aa4136d0498ba7b48367c8001ac462bd0)) ([d9f54fc](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d9f54fc09925171c6c0a933abd33507f85e8851c))
* The built-in tool-usage prompt constants `TASK_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `ASYNC_TASK_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `FILESYSTEM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and `EXECUTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` are removed, and the `system_prompt` default on `SubAgentMiddleware`, `AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`, `SummarizationToolMiddleware`, and `create_summarization_tool_middleware` is now `None`, which injects no prose. Pass your own string to restore prompt text. ([#4859](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4859)) ([a8d1b32](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/a8d1b32aa4136d0498ba7b48367c8001ac462bd0))
* `FilesystemBackend` and `LocalShellBackend` now default to `virtual_mode=True`. Filesystem paths are anchored under `root_dir`, `..` traversal is rejected, and paths resolving outside `root_dir` raise `ValueError`. Previously an unspecified `virtual_mode` emitted a deprecation warning and fell back to `False`, where absolute host paths were used as-is and `..` could escape `root_dir`. Pass `virtual_mode=False` explicitly to restore the old filesystem behavior. ([#4541](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4541)) ([540a0fa](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/540a0fa7eb9a88d82413cf10a5cb5c807d491385))
* Agents now see a destructive, recursive `delete` filesystem tool whenever the backend supports it, and filesystem permissions classify `delete` as a write operation — so an existing rule allowing writes to a path also authorizes recursively deleting that subtree unless a narrower deny or interrupt rule covers the target. Because recursive deletes affect descendants, deny and interrupt checks use bulk path overlap instead of exact-path matching. To keep the previous behavior, add a deny or interrupt rule, or omit `delete` from `FilesystemMiddleware(tools=...)`. Missing paths return a not-found error, `CompositeBackend` reports an unsupported-operation error when a routed sub-backend cannot delete, and the tool is hidden from the model entirely when the backend itself does not implement it. ([#3659](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3659)) ([#3691](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3691)) ([#3765](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3765)) ([#3851](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3851)) ([f2a21ec](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/f2a21ec1606c2560bd2fd5765409a05c2a44edee))
* `write_file` can now create a file if it is missing and replaces it entirely if it already exists, instead of returning a file-exists error. The `write_file` tool description no longer requires reading the file first. There is no "create-only" compatibility mode. Workflows, prompts, tests, or guardrails that relied on the file-exists error to force `edit_file` usage or to protect existing content must omit `write_file`, add explicit permission or interrupt rules, or use `edit_file` where preserving existing content matters. ([#4109](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4109)) ([2506fcc](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/2506fccfac0e09b656d5e2fefe23162f1c762331))
* Removed deprecated backend compatibility shims. Callers must pass concrete `BackendProtocol` instances (not factories), configure `StoreBackend` with an explicit `namespace`, and use the current `ls` / `glob` / `grep` / `ReadResult` APIs. ([#4541](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4541)) ([540a0fa](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/540a0fa7eb9a88d82413cf10a5cb5c807d491385))
* The deprecated `files_update` attribute and constructor keyword are removed from `WriteResult` and `EditResult`. Custom backends must stop passing `files_update=`, and callers must stop reading `result.files_update`; state writes are emitted directly by `StateBackend`. ([#4541](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4541)) ([540a0fa](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/540a0fa7eb9a88d82413cf10a5cb5c807d491385))
* Removed the deprecated `BackendProtocol` methods `ls_info`, `als_info`, `glob_info`, `aglob_info`, `grep_raw`, and `agrep_raw`. Use `ls` / `glob` / `grep` and their async counterparts. ([#4541](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4541)) ([540a0fa](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/540a0fa7eb9a88d82413cf10a5cb5c807d491385))
* `SummarizationMiddleware(history_path_prefix=...)` was removed and now raises `TypeError`. Configure `CompositeBackend(artifacts_root=...)` instead. ([#4541](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4541)) ([540a0fa](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/540a0fa7eb9a88d82413cf10a5cb5c807d491385))
* Agent-facing `ls` and `glob` tool output now renders empty results as `No files found` instead of `[]`; direct backend APIs continue to return structured empty `LsResult` and `GlobResult` values. Callers that parse tool output should update those checks. ([#3709](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3709)) ([efafd1e](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/efafd1e070aeae8901ee3123c7fcbf1815a33c4f))
* `read_file` no longer renders raw text with a fixed-width `cat -n`-style line-number gutter and tab separator. Line and continuation markers are dynamically aligned and separated from source content by two spaces, and the `LINE_NUMBER_WIDTH` constant is removed from `deepagents.backends.utils` and `deepagents.middleware.filesystem`. Callers that parse raw tool output should update those parsers. ([#4561](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4561)) ([cf057b4](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/cf057b4bcdb77ad67014f7dabe71e71f2366c95e))

### Features

* Custom middleware passed to `create_deep_agent(..., middleware=[...])` can replace a default middleware instance when `.name` matches, so defaults such as `SummarizationMiddleware` can be overridden without also excluding the built-in instance. ([#4251](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4251)) ([90c8472](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/90c8472ae226394a186bf2075459645c2056db7d))
* `FilesystemMiddleware(tools=[...])` accepts a keyword-only allowlist of built-in filesystem tools, typed by the newly exported `FsToolName` literal (`"ls"`, `"read_file"`, `"write_file"`, `"edit_file"`, `"delete"`, `"glob"`, `"grep"`, `"execute"`); pass `"all"` or omit the argument to keep every tool. A list must include `"read_file"` or the constructor raises `ValueError`. Omitted built-in tools are non-executable, and custom user tools are unaffected. ([#4325](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4325)) ([#4698](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4698)) ([704a70d](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/704a70dddbd59b8c6abf658a4211c76bce1445f0)) ([9709525](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/970952550e8f53cd89a64a4ee98969ce757693ff))
* Shorten LLM-facing descriptions for the `task` tool and filesystem tools (`read_file`, `grep`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `execute`). ([#5009](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/5009)) ([761f5f0](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/761f5f0882dee186f2700f3c903829a5542626fe))
* `GrepResult` and `GlobResult` now carry a `truncated` flag so supporting backends can return valid partial results when a match cap or backend deadline is reached; agent-facing tool output adds a note telling the model to narrow the search. `FilesystemBackend` returns partial `grep` and `glob` results on its backend timeout rather than erroring, while other backend or middleware timeouts may still return errors. Its `glob` also gains brace expansion such as `*.{py,md}` (already supported by the state and store backends). ([#4063](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4063)) ([ef591e7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/ef591e7a86b13bbdcb0fdedd45a8f1fe33573839))
* The agent-facing `grep` match cap is configurable: `FilesystemMiddleware(grep_max_count=...)` sets the default (`1000`; `None` disables it) and the model can override it per call through the tool's new `max_count` argument. `grep` / `agrep` on `BackendProtocol` and all built-in backends accept a keyword-only `max_count`. Local ripgrep output is streamed and terminated once the cap is reached. Direct `FilesystemBackend.grep()` callers can request surrounding lines with keyword-only `context_lines`. ([#4570](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4570)) ([#4706](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4706)) ([8e86f5e](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/8e86f5ecc8908762a2c748880287f190dde70600)) ([65230df](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/65230df6f91d2bbe5f83d4d938da6bfac52363a1))
* Paginated built-in `read_file` responses report the returned source-line range and next `offset`; total and remaining line counts are included when the backend knows the file length. Resume offsets remain safe when sandbox or middleware limits shorten the visible page. ([#4540](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4540)) ([8321194](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/83211940a2cdf4c52ac21a6cde8647716a998504))
* Optional video frame extraction for `read_file`, enabled by the new `deepagents[video]` extra. Video files are sampled into JPEG frames, with `offset` and `limit` interpreted as seconds. Without the extra, existing generic video/file content-block behavior remains. ([#4094](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4094)) ([b927147](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/b927147d026749c6c790bb06c9853515dabf579c))
* `FilesystemMiddleware` can capture oversized `execute` tool output directly inside the sandbox artifact path on compatible, opted-in `BaseSandbox` implementations to reduce round trips; `LangSmithSandbox` opts in by default. ([#4230](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4230)) ([02f5bd7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/02f5bd7bc02f2baaf5a1eefce7d686ba62493647))
* Automatically enable Fireworks prompt-cache session affinity when a compatible `langchain-fireworks` installation is available. ([#4598](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4598)) ([5d878bf](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/5d878bf1341afc3f96398733b7ef18eec4b66139))
* Add a built-in NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra harness profile and NVIDIA NIM app-origin attribution. ([#4192](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4192)) ([#4455](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4455)) ([d5a60ec](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d5a60ece7379c37c81edcef2cd6c2811ddc90c9a)) ([4cb4749](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/4cb47491b024991322b7c24062c58cbcdc26a727))
* `RubricMiddleware` now accepts any positive `max_iterations` cap instead of enforcing a hard upper bound. ([#4405](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4405)) ([d6692a7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d6692a7c713490f170b17510d613e02ee37574ab))

### Bug Fixes

* Keep fields marked with `PrivateStateAttr`, including fields declared through `create_deep_agent(state_schema=...)`, out of subagent inputs and returned parent-state updates. ([#4587](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4587)) ([a4662c0](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/a4662c07296c378045006c9f45ed1d12bd1a9da6))
* Preserve `ContextT` through the `create_deep_agent(..., middleware=[...])` type annotation so type checkers accept context-aware middleware when a matching `context_schema` is passed. ([#4055](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4055)) ([7be76c7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/7be76c752117e6e61dcdc931ea5147261fad6768))
* Accept YAML list values as well as comma-separated strings for skill `allowed-tools` frontmatter, and make skill truncation warnings actionable with field name, path, length, configured limit, and impact. ([#4140](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4140)) ([#4141](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4141)) ([d62534c](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d62534c86b87a91aca16c6bfb71209232d69a6ec)) ([2f5f5b8](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/2f5f5b85793d944167a42e8d5b8e0a11bb1e3932))
* Align filesystem instructions with the tools that remain after allowlist and backend-capability filtering, so agents no longer reference hidden `grep`/`glob` tools or prohibit equivalent shell search when dedicated search tools are unavailable. ([#4920](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4920)) ([#4921](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4921)) ([d3650c7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d3650c7b1f5ca968abd72345a511719d4ba65907)) ([b65cc00](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/b65cc0076caab2e35c07598055b8b338a47e5e1a))
* Propagate default-backend failures from `CompositeBackend.ls("/")` and `CompositeBackend.als("/")` instead of returning successful route-only listings. ([#4925](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4925)) ([4c3b166](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/4c3b1667035e3be6ae88cf8c431e0d6f143d2ff4))
* Correct `CompositeBackend.glob` / `CompositeBackend.aglob` routing so explicit default-backend paths such as `/tools` do not also return files from routed backends such as `/memories`. ([#4531](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4531)) ([cbdb0a7](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/cbdb0a7df8cd4bbacff9ca7ac2e42232ef290c10))
* Propagate default- and routed-backend failures from root `CompositeBackend.glob(..., path=None)` / `aglob(..., path=None)` and `path="/"` searches instead of returning incomplete successful results.

* Constrain sandbox `glob` and slash-pattern `grep` searches to their declared search root by treating leading `/` as search-root-relative, rejecting `..` traversal segments, and filtering symlink-resolved matches outside the root.

* Unify `grep(..., glob=...)` include-glob semantics across filesystem and in-memory backends: basename patterns like `*.py` match at any depth, and slash-containing patterns like `src/**/*.py` match relative paths consistently. ([#3936](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3936)) ([feab6e0](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/feab6e0b3762aa42fa458af16d0a3e8d04d8b075))
* Improve agent-facing `grep` descriptions and no-match hints to steer regex-looking patterns toward literal searches, route slash-containing sandbox include-globs correctly, and shorten default search timeouts so bad patterns and huge trees return guidance faster. ([#4168](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4168)) ([b1dbf5e](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/b1dbf5e66ac81a9fd95abf6987ba058bb14a5edf))
* Align sandbox delete behavior with other backends by returning not-found errors for missing paths, and avoid over-blocking unrelated sibling deletes when deny rules use glob patterns. ([#4321](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4321)) ([d77496b](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/d77496b969b9c59ce1c7c44e2085e5388e12c306))
* Improve rubric grader failure diagnostics with configured model, structured-output strategy, and integer HTTP status when available.

* Emit `max_iterations_reached` as the terminal `RubricMiddleware` status when the iteration cap is exhausted, instead of a final `needs_revision` event that will not loop. ([#4406](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/4406)) ([a51c8d2](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/a51c8d2b1723d143439a1466f5a49a52c442bdfc))
* Handle missing async subagent URLs consistently in `check_async_task` and `cancel_async_task`. ([#3967](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/issues/3967)) ([b0d92c0](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/commit/b0d92c0f38ca0aa037b56e26b2b0d322cdd07856))

## [0.5.4](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/compare/deepagents==0.5.3...deepagents==0.5.4) (2026-04-29)

### Highlights

Until this release, `deepagents` shipped a single set of prompts, tools, and middleware tuned to work across *all* model families. Today's headline change is **harness profiles** — a declarative override layer for the parts of the harness that vary per model (system-prompt prefix/suffix, tool inclusion and naming, middleware selection, subagent configuration, skills). `ProviderProfile` shapes how `resolve_model` builds the client; `HarnessProfile` / `HarnessProfileConfig` shape how `create_deep_agent` assembles the agent. Both are keyed by provider (`"openai"`) or full `provider:model` spec (`"openai:gpt-5.4"`), and registrations are additive — your call site doesn't change when you swap models.

We currently ship built-ins for OpenAI and Anthropic out of the box, drawn directly from each vendor's published prompting guides (Codex's `apply_patch` / `shell_command` conventions, Claude's tool-result reflection and active-investigation patterns, etc.). On a curated tau2-bench subset, applying these profiles produced a 10–20 point lift over the default harness (GPT-5.3 Codex: 33% -> 53%; Claude Opus 4.7: 43% -> 53%). Third-party plugins can register via the `deepagents.provider_profiles` and `deepagents.harness_profiles` entry points.

See the [profiles documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/profiles) for the full field surface, merge semantics, and plugin packaging.
