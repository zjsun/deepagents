    Scans every installed distribution named `deepagents` for PEP 610
    `direct_url.json` with `dir_info.editable: true`, and reports `True` only for
    a record whose source root actually contains the module this code is running
    from.

    Both halves are load-bearing, and they guard opposite errors:

    - Scanning, rather than a single `importlib.metadata.distribution` lookup,
      avoids a false negative. `setuptools` leaves a gitignored
      `deepagents.egg-info/` in the source tree after any local build, and the cwd
      is on `sys.path` for `-c`, `-m`, and the REPL, so that `*.egg-info` is found
      *first* when running from the checkout. It carries no `direct_url.json`, so
      the single-lookup form reports "not editable" and never consults the real
      editable install in site-packages.
    - Correlating against the running module avoids a false positive. An
      environment can hold more than one `deepagents` record — a wheel earlier on
      `sys.path` and an unrelated editable checkout later on it. Only the wheel's
      code is actually imported, so marking it `+editable` because some other
      checkout exists would attribute a workspace build to a published install.

    Per-distribution metadata failures are contained by the helpers above, so one
    unreadable distribution cannot end the scan early and mask a later editable
    one. Missing or unparseable metadata reports non-editable, keeping version
    reporting best-effort rather than a source of construction failures.
